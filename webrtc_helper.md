In the next part of this guide, we will delve into how to establish a basic peer connection and handle media streams and tracks, complete with code snippets and detailed explanations. Stay tuned!
Basic Implementation of WebRTC Android

Having set up your development environment, you can now dive into the core of WebRTC functionality on Android. This section covers the fundamental steps to establish a peer connection and manage media streams, providing practical code snippets to help you understand the process.
Establishing a Peer Connection

A peer connection forms the backbone of any WebRTC android application, facilitating the direct communication link between two devices. This connection handles the transmission of audio, video, and data.
Initialization of PeerConnectionFactory

Before creating a peer connection, you need to initialize the PeerConnectionFactory. This factory is crucial as it generates the instances required for managing the media streams and the connections themselves. Include the following setup in your Android project:

// Initialize PeerConnectionFactory globals.
PeerConnectionFactory.InitializationOptions initializationOptions =
    PeerConnectionFactory.InitializationOptions.builder(context)
        .createInitializationOptions();
PeerConnectionFactory.initialize(initializationOptions);

// Create a new PeerConnectionFactory instance.
PeerConnectionFactory.Options options = new PeerConnectionFactory.Options();
PeerConnectionFactory peerConnectionFactory = PeerConnectionFactory.builder()
    .setOptions(options)
    .createPeerConnectionFactory();

Creating the PeerConnection

After setting up the factory, the next step is to create a peer connection object. This object uses configurations for STUN and TURN servers, which facilitate the connection across different networks and NATs (Network Address Translators):

// Configuration for the peer connection.
List<PeerConnection.IceServer> iceServers = new ArrayList<>();
iceServers.add(PeerConnection.IceServer.builder("stun:stun.l.google.com:19302").createIceServer());

PeerConnection.RTCConfiguration rtcConfig = new PeerConnection.RTCConfiguration(iceServers);
// Create the peer connection instance.
PeerConnection peerConnection = peerConnectionFactory.createPeerConnection(rtcConfig, new PeerConnection.Observer() {
    @Override
    public void onSignalingChange(PeerConnection.SignalingState signalingState) {}

    @Override
    public void onIceConnectionChange(PeerConnection.IceConnectionState iceConnectionState) {}

    @Override
    public void onIceConnectionReceivingChange(boolean b) {}

    @Override
    public void onIceGatheringChange(PeerConnection.IceGatheringState iceGatheringState) {}

    @Override
    public void onIceCandidate(IceCandidate iceCandidate) {}

    @Override
    public void onIceCandidatesRemoved(IceCandidate[] iceCandidates) {}

    @Override
    public void onAddStream(MediaStream mediaStream) {}

    @Override
    public void onRemoveStream(MediaStream mediaStream) {}

    @Override
    public void onDataChannel(DataChannel dataChannel) {}

    @Override
    public void onRenegotiationNeeded() {}
});

Handling Media Streams and Tracks

Managing media involves creating and manipulating audio and video streams that are transmitted over the network. This involves capturing media from the device's hardware, like the camera and microphone, and preparing it for transmission.
Creating Audio and Video Tracks

You need to create audio and video sources and tracks from these sources. These tracks are then added to the peer connection and managed throughout the life cycle of the application:

// Create an AudioSource instance.
AudioSource audioSource = peerConnectionFactory.createAudioSource(new MediaConstraints());
AudioTrack localAudioTrack = peerConnectionFactory.createAudioTrack("101", audioSource);

// Create a VideoSource instance.
VideoSource videoSource = peerConnectionFactory.createVideoSource(false);
SurfaceTextureHelper surfaceTextureHelper = SurfaceTextureHelper.create("CaptureThread", eglBaseContext);
VideoCapturer videoCapturer = createCameraCapturer(new Camera1Enumerator(false));
videoCapturer.initialize(surfaceTextureHelper, context, videoSource.getCapturerObserver());
videoCapturer.startCapture(1000, 1000, 30);

VideoTrack localVideoTrack = peerConnectionFactory.createVideoTrack("102", videoSource);
localVideoTrack.setEnabled(true);

// Add tracks to peer connection.
peerConnection.addTrack(localAudioTrack);
peerConnection.addTrack(localVideoTrack);

In this section, we explored how to establish a peer connection and handle audio and video streams in a WebRTC Android application. By following these steps and integrating the provided code snippets, you can build a basic real-time
Advanced Features and Use Cases of WebRTC Android

After establishing the basic peer connection and handling media streams, it's time to explore more advanced features and potential use cases for WebRTC on Android. This part of the article delves into enhancing WebRTC applications with additional UI components, and building a comprehensive video chat application.
Enhancing WebRTC Android with UI Components

Integrating user interface (UI) components effectively is crucial for developing functional and user-friendly real-time communication apps. The use of SurfaceViewRenderer and VideoTextureViewRenderer enables the display and manipulation of video streams in the UI, providing a seamless user experience.
Customizing Video Components

The following snippet shows how to set up a SurfaceViewRenderer to display video:

// Setup the local video track to be displayed in a SurfaceViewRenderer.
SurfaceViewRenderer localVideoView = findViewById(R.id.local_video_view);
localVideoView.init(eglBaseContext, null);
localVideoView.setZOrderMediaOverlay(true);
localVideoView.setMirror(true);

// Attach the video track to the renderer.
localVideoTrack.addSink(localVideoView);

This setup includes initializing the renderer, setting its properties for overlay and mirroring, and attaching the video track. It ensures that the video stream from the device's camera is displayed correctly in the application's interface.
Handling Multiple Video Streams

In more complex applications, such as multi-user video conferences, managing multiple video streams becomes necessary. Each participant's video needs to be displayed simultaneously, requiring dynamic management of UI components:

// Assume a dynamic layout that can add or remove video views as needed.
for (PeerConnection pc : allPeerConnections) {
    SurfaceViewRenderer remoteVideoView = new SurfaceViewRenderer(context);
    remoteVideoView.init(eglBaseContext, null);
    videoLayout.addView(remoteVideoView);
    pc.getRemoteVideoTrack().addSink(remoteVideoView);
}

This code snippet suggests a way to iterate over all active peer connections, initializing a new video renderer for each and attaching the remote video track. It exemplifies how to dynamically add video views to a layout, accommodating any number of participants.
Building a Complete WebRTC Android Video Chat Application

Creating a full-fledged video chat application involves not only managing video streams but also handling signaling and network traversal, session descriptions, and ICE candidates efficiently.
Integrating Signaling

Signaling is an essential part of establishing a peer connection in WebRTC Android, used for coordinating communication and managing sessions. Here's a basic overview of how signaling could be implemented using WebSocket:

WebSocketClient client = new WebSocketClient(uri) {
    @Override
    public void onOpen(ServerHandshake handshakedata) {
        // Send offer/answer and ICE candidates to the remote peer.
    }

    @Override
    public void onMessage(String message) {
        // Handle incoming offers, answers, and ICE candidates.
    }

    @Override
    public void onClose(int code, String reason, boolean remote) {
        // Handle closure of connection.
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Exception ex) {
        // Handle errors during communication.
    }
};
client.connect();

This WebSocket client setup facilitates the real-time exchange of signaling data necessary to initiate and maintain WebRTC Android connections.
Session Management and ICE Handling

Efficiently managing session descriptions and ICE candidates ensures that connections are established quickly and remain stable, even across complex network configurations:

// Handling an offer received from a remote peer.
peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new SimpleSdpObserver(), sessionDescription);
peerConnection.createAnswer(new SimpleSdpObserver() {
    @Override
    public void onCreateSuccess(SessionDescription sdp) {
        peerConnection.setLocalDescription(new SimpleSdpObserver(), sdp);
        // Send the answer back to the remote peer through the signaling channel.
    }
}, new MediaConstraints());

// Adding received ICE candidates.
peerConnection.addIceCandidate(iceCandidate);

This section focuses on integrating UI components and building a comprehensive system for a multi-user video chat application using WebRTC on Android. These advanced implementations illustrate the capabilities of WebRTC Android in handling real-time media and data interactions, providing developers with the tools needed to create robust and interactive communication applications.
